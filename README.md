  RAGLAM: Retrieval-Augmented Generation and LLM Workflow
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using LangChain, LangGraph, and ChatOllama. It demonstrates how to build and optimize workflows for document retrieval, language model cost-efficiency, and hallucination detection in AI models.
Features
•	Document Retrieval: Retrieve and assess document relevance to user questions.
•	RAG Pipelines: Implement retrieval-augmented generation to produce accurate and context-aware answers.
•	LLM Optimization: Strategies to reduce LLM operational costs, including prompt optimization and model distillation.
•	Hallucination Detection: Evaluate the grounding of LLM outputs against provided facts.
•	LangGraph Integration: Define and execute workflows with state-based graphs.
Technologies Used
•	LangChain: For constructing RAG pipelines.
•	LangGraph: For stateful workflow management.
•	ChatOllama: LLM for text generation and grading tasks.
•	Python: Core programming language.
•	Jupyter Notebook: Interactive environment for building and testing the workflow.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
1.	Install Python 3.8+.
2.	Install the required libraries: 
3.	pip install langchain langchain-community langchain-core langgraph
Setup
1.	Clone the repository:
2.	git clone https://github.com/your-username/RAGLAM.git
3.	cd RAGLAM
4.	Set up your environment:
    o Create an API key for TavilySearch (if applicable) and set it as an environment variable: 
    o	export TAVILY_API_KEY='your-api-key'
5.	Open the Jupyter notebook:
6.	jupyter notebook "RAGLAM.ipynb"
How to Use
1.	Document Retrieval: 
  o	Input a question, and the workflow retrieves relevant documents using a vector store or web search.
2.	Grading Pipeline: 
  o	The notebook filters irrelevant results and flags hallucinations in generated answers.
3.	Text Generation: 
  o	Outputs concise, grounded answers based on the retrieved context.
4.	Customizable Workflows: 
  o	Modify the graph states and nodes for task-specific needs.
Key Functions
  •	retrieve: Fetches documents from the vector store.
  •	grade_documents: Evaluates the relevance of documents to the user query.
  •	generate: Produces responses using RAG pipelines.
  •	web_search: Integrates search results for improved context.
  •	decide_to_generate: Determines whether to generate or fetch more data.
Sample Workflow
inputs = {"question": "How to save LLM costs?"}
for output in app.stream(inputs):
    print(output)
